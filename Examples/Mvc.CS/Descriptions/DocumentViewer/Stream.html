When you don't have a file on disk, you can use SetDocumentStream method instead of DocumentPath property.
The method accepts a callback delegate to return an opened stream containing the document.
The stream is not required to be seekable because it will be immediately copied to cache folder if not already exists.
This callback will only be called when necessary, i.e. if the stream is already cached before or if the required
conversions are already done and cached before then the callback will not be called. The reason this
is implemented as a callback rather than a direct Stream instance is for extra performance,
consider that opening a stream is costly in your implementation, for example you are retrieving it from network
or a database or even from a zip file so opening the stream only when it's really necessary would be more
performant when your document is viewed several times by several users.
