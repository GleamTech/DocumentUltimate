The Document Viewer uses a special web-friendly format which is also encrypted so your documents are
copy-protected out of the box. However there are some options in the UI which allows your users to download the
original document or replicate it via printing and copying text but you can always disable them when required.
<br/><br />
The "Download" button which allows the user to download the original document can be disabled
for security (DRM) purpose. For example, consider you have a DOCX file (e.g. a design template) and
you want the user to view this file but you do not want him to download and edit this file.
<br /><br />
For additional security (DRM) purpose, you can also disable printing of the displayed document.
"Download as PDF" button is also effected by DisablePrint property because downloading 
for example a DOCX file as a PDF file is considered same as printing that document.

For additional security (DRM) purpose, you can also disable selecting and copying text in the displayed document.
