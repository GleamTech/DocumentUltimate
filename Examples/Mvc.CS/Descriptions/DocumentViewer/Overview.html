Document Viewer supports wide range of document formats. Once the document is converted to a special
web-friendly format on first-view (done automatically in the background and the result is cached), 
subsequent views will be instant. Document Viewer is very fast because it does not load the whole
document at once, it smartly loads only the pages you are currently viewing.
