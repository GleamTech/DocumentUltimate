Component can be hidden when page is first loaded by setting Hidden property to <b>true</b>. It can be displayed on demand by calling Show function of the client-side component object.
For instance, a button click event can be used to show/hide the component.
<br /><br />
By default, the component is rendered inline, i.e it's rendered exactly where the component tag is inserted.
However it's also possible to display the component as a modal dialog by setting DisplayMode property to <b>Window</b> and setting WindowOptions sub-properties.
