    Document Viewer supports wide range of document formats. Once the document is converted to a special
    web-friendly format on first-view (done automatically in the background and the result is cached),
    subsequent views will be instant. Document Viewer is very fast because it does not load the whole
    document at once, it smartly loads only the pages you are currently viewing.

<p>
    A document is loaded by simply setting DocumentViewer.Document property.
    This is usually the path to the document to load.
    Both physical (eg. c:\document.docx) and virtual (eg. /document.docx or ~/document.docx) paths are supported.

<p>
    If a custom document handler is provided via DocumentViewer.DocumentHandlerType property, then
    the value set in DocumentViewer.Document property will be passed to that handler which should open 
    and return a readable stream according to this file identifier.
    So it can be any string value that your IDocumentHandler implementation understands.
    With a custom document handler, you can load documents from database, network, cloud storage etc.
