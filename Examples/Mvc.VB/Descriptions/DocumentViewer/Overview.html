    Document Viewer supports wide range of document formats. Once the document is converted to a special
    web-friendly format on first-view (done automatically in the background and the result is cached),
    subsequent views will be instant. Document Viewer is very fast because it does not load the whole
    document at once, it smartly loads only the pages you are currently viewing.

    DocumentSource class defines a document that can be loaded either from a file on disk, a stream or a byte array.
    You can simpy set DocumentViewer.Document property to a string which contains the document path or to a DocumentSource
    instance created from a stream or byte array. DocumentSource class can be implicitly casted from string automatically
    so for files on disk you can simply pass the path string to DocumentViewer.Document property.
